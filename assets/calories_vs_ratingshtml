    This scatterplot investigates the relationship between calorie count and user rating.
    Despite the wide range of calories (0–2000 kcal), ratings remain consistently high — clustering around 4.5 stars.
    The trendline confirms there is no strong correlation. This suggests that users rate recipes based more on taste or satisfaction than on nutritional content.
